These are hooks into anaconda to manage some rocks-added capabilities.
#1 - lighttpd service (used for avalanche/scalable installation) must be 
started in the context of the initial ram disk AND restarted when the 
installer transitions from its initrd state to the running state.  It's
a more complicated setup because of this.

#2 - rockspart service. This enables stateful partitions on compute nodes.
This needs to be called when in the running state, but before anaconda the
kickstart file is read by anaconda. It is setup as systemd service. It is
turned on in the postinstall configuration of the rocks-boot-7 package.
